## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow's developer data to better understand:

  1. How important is formal education and schooling in a successful developer's career?
  2. What were the different method's helped to become a developer?
  3. Different resources to self taught a programming technology?
  4. How official documentation helped to learn mew skills?
  
## File Description
   There is a jupyter notebook available which will help you to guide through the above questions 
   
## Results 
The main findings of the code can be found at the post here(https://medium.com/@saumyagarg2299/significance-of-education-in-a-successful-developers-career-cc9ba69d59c?source=friends_link&sk=a4475b66d3927bd8389a7ea17aa52694.)
              Brief findings of the questions :
  - Formal education was important upto some extent for a successful developer's career .
  - Self-study and taking an online course were the best ways to become a developer.
  - Official Documentation and Stack Overflow Q&A were the self-study resources developers suggested . 

## Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. Grateful to the whole udacity team and the mentors of "Data Scientist Nanodegree program" .Feel free to use the code as you would like!
